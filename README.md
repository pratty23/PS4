Problem 1.)

https://simplymusic.herokuapp.com

Our Django backend has been deployed through Heroku and has been populated using an intial fixture file so that there are already several users, ratings, and artist bios.  Improving on the areas in which we lost points for HW3, we were able to use validators to make sure ratings can only be 0-5 and years for album release dates 1800-2022.

Our React frontend has been deployed through Firebase, but despite countless hours of debugging, adjusting urls, rewriting API calls, etc, does not connect to the Django backend on Heroku.

Problem 2.)

This is the frontend of the mobile Music app.
